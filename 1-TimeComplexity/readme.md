# **Time Complexity**

#### Time complexity is not equal to the time taken for a program or code to get executed. This is because the time taken for a code to get executed can vary on different operating systems or machines.

### <br>**_So what then is time complexity ?_**

#### Time complexity is the rate at which the time taken for a code or program to execute increases with respect to the size of an input.

#### <br>Let's break this down. For example, the time taken for a loop to traverse an array or a list of 100 items will differ from the time taken for it to traverse an array of 10000 items.

> _An array of 100 or 10000 items used is this example is the input and it can vary at any point in time._

#### <br>So if it takes one second for the code(loop in this case) to run through an array(input) of 100 items. When the array(input) is increased to 10000 items it takes maybe two seconds. The rate at which the time taken for the code (loop in this case) to run through the array of items increases with respect to their size is called time complexity.

#### <br> You must also understand that even though time complexity was illustrated using the use of seconds as a unit of measurement, it is not measured in seconds neither is it measured in minutes.

> _Time complexity is measured in Big-O-notation O(n)._

#### Big-O-notation is the number of steps taken for a code or program to execute.
